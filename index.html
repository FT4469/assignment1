      <h2>
        A Combative Trump and a Deliberate Biden Spar From Afar at Town Halls
      </h2> 
    </div>
    <div class="twelve columns">
      <p>
       President Trump spoke positively about an extremist conspiracy-theory group, expressed skepticism about mask-wearing, rebuked his own F.B.I. director and attacked the legitimacy of the 2020 election in a televised town hall forum on Thursday, veering far away from a focused campaign appeal. Instead, he further stoked the country’s political rifts as his Democratic opponent,Joseph R. Biden Jr., pushed a deliberate message anchored in concerns over public health and promises to restore political norms.
     </p>    
     <p>
      Mr. Trump’s defensive and combative performance came on a night that was supposed to feature a debate between him and Mr. Biden, but that morphed into a long-distance study in contrasts on different television networks after the president declined to participate in a virtual debate.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the central issue of the election, the coronavirus pandemic, the two candidates appeared to inhabit not just different television sets but different universes. Mr. Biden has made the full embrace of strict public health guidelines the centerpiece of his candidacy, while Mr. Trump has continued to defy even the recommendations of his own government on matters as basic as the use of masks — a pattern that persisted in their opposing events on Thursday.

        Biden Beats Trump in Ratings Battle of the Network Town Halls

          Television ratings matter to President Trump. So these numbers may sting.
        </p>
        <p>  In a victory that few in the TV and political arenas predicted, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s town hall-style forum on ABC on Thursday night drew a larger audience than President Trump’s competing event on NBC, according to Nielsen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Biden’s town-hall meeting, which aired on a single network, was seen by an average of 15.1 million viewers, compared with 13.5 million for Mr. Trump even though the president monopolized three networks — NBC, MSNBC and CNBC — simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          The town halls were vastly different television spectacles, befitting their respective protagonists. For an hour on NBC, Mr. Trump was darting and defiant as the “Today” host Savannah Guthrie pressed him to denounce QAnon and white supremacy (Mr. Trump hesitated on both) and clear up questions about his medical condition.

           The company was until recently flying a “Trump 2020’’ flag over its Cleveland headquarters. The problems it has had underscore the stress that mail voting has put on the nation’s election process amid the pandemic.
